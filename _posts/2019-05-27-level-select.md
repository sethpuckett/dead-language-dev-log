Now that I can store more than 1 level I need to add a way to choose between those levels. I'm adding a map screen to take care of that. The map screen is broken up into several sections. It's a work in progress, but I'm happy with how it's coming along.

### Map

The map is where the player can choose between different lessons. I'm not sure how many there will be yet. 20? 50? 100?

### Lesson Info

Under the map is the lesson info section. This will show details and grammar tips regarding the currently selected lesson.

### Stage Select

Each lesson will have 3-5 stages where the player can slowly build their vocabulary or grammatical knowledge. Each lesson will also have a final review stage that incorporates everything from that lesson.

### Stage Type

Right now I only have 1 minigame, but I in time I will add more. This section will show which type of game the current stage is.

### Instructions

And the last area is just a bit of instructional text to help the player navigate the screen.
