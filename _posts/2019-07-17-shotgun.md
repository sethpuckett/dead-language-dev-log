I've been on vacation for the last couple weeks, so this update took a while.

I've added the first new weapon type to the game: The shotgun! It kills Bruisers with a single shot, but it has limited ammo.

Getting this to work required a lot of updates. I had to implement zombie health, and I had to add logic to keep track of current & total ammo, and I had to get the UI to show the current amount of ammo. The code is a little sloppy, so I think I need to take some time to clean it up before I start implementing anything new.
