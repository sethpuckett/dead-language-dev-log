I put some work into a nicer looking title screen with some shambling zombie animations. All the artwork came from the [indie bundle]((https://www.humblebundle.com/software/8bit-pixel-game-dev-software)) I bought a few weeks ago.

I also added support for alternative answers/synonyms. So now each word can support multiple answers (e.g. 'car' can be 'carro' or 'coche').

It's a very no-frills game at this point, but it is now at a playable state. I'm going to shift gears for a bit and add a basic tutorial screen and a study/vocab list screen. Then I can start sharing it more widely.
